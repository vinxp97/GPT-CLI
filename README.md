# GPT-CLI
I created a command-line based utility that enabled you to have conversations with GPT-4 using Python. This was originally made in May 2023.

The goal of the project was to learn how to use env files within my projects. Concepts used:

1. Using Python Classes
2. Connecting to external APIs (Such as OpenAI's API)
3. Connecting to locally-hosted LLMs in LM Studio
